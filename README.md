## Markdown Visual for Power BI

Markdown-visual is a simple markdown visualizer for Power BI. It uses the showdown.js library (a bidirectional Markdown to HTML converter) and is free from external dependencies. This tool enables you to render markdown content within your Power BI reports, making it easier to communicate information effectively.

> **Important Update:** We have now added a sanitization layer to the HTML generated by showdown.js. We use the DOMPurify library to sanitize the HTML content before setting it to the target element. This significantly improves the safety of the HTML content by removing any potentially malicious content. However, it's important to note that no sanitization method can guarantee 100% safety. Therefore, always be cautious when dealing with HTML content, even when it has been sanitized. Please make sure to always use the `sanitizeAndSetHtml` method when you need to set HTML content to an element, to ensure that the content is as safe as possible.

## Features

- Seamless integration with Power BI reports.
